        <p>Hi! My name is Betsy Lambert, and I am a sophomore at Washington and Lee University. With minors in both Data Science and Mathematics, I have always been curious about the world around us and how and why things work the way they do. At W&L with a liberal arts education, I have been able to further develop my soft skills and strive to reach my full potential. Being from Alabama, I have a passion for the outdoors and living in Virginia has allowed me to futher those passions with the various rivers and mountains around Lexington.<br/>
          <br/>
          This summer, I had the oppourtunity to work in Jackson, Wyoming where I was surrounded by the great outdoors. With access to the Grand Teton National Park, it was an incredible summer being able to further develop my passion for hiking and the outdoors. Being close the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia, it has been a rewarding experience to surround myself with people who also strive to get outside and discover the beauty of this world. <br/>
          <br/>
          At W&L, I am involved in the Fancy Dress Commitee, as a member of the PR and Marketing Team, where I assist in planning one of W&L's most known annual traditions. I also serve alongside Habitat for Humanity, through the Generals Repairs Club, to benefit the greater Rockbridge County Area in home repair projects.

      <p class="pt-5 text-center">I am currently a sophomore at Washington and Lee University where I intend on pursuing a Business Administration degree with a minor in Mathematics and Data Science. Going to a liberal arts school like W&L, I have been able to explore various areas of study and develop a range of skills and interests. Looking into the future, I hope to use my skills developed in college to pursue a career in the business, and more specifically, the finance industry.</p>

      <p class="pt-5 text-center">Growing up, I attended the Mountain Brook school systems in Birmingham, Alabama for all 13 years. I graduated with honors from Mountain Brook High School in May 2021. High school allowed me to further my academic interests and much of my courseload now stems from my challenging, yet effective high school experience. I had the privilige of being a Mountain Brook High School Student Ambassador, where I assisted incoming students and welcomed new families into the school system, assuring them a smooth transition. </p>

      <p class="text-center pt-4">Pictured above, is one of the first assignments I completed in the DCI-110 Course. By recreating this website, I was able to further my HTML and CSS skills by including different background colors, implementing links into text, and working with spacing. The biggest challenge in this assignment was adjusting the location of the headers and paragraphs and using the correct code to properly align the text. Overall, this assignment created a strong foundation for the basic understanding of HTML and CSS that led me to create more complex code moving forward.</p>

      <p class="text-center pt-2">Pictured below, is the second assignment I completed once learning how to use Bootstrap CSS and how to create a webpage with Bootstrap CSS. In this assignment, I learned how to implement a carosuel, a modal, cards, and a footer. After completing this website, I was better able to understand Bootstrap and become more familiar with implementing its elements in code, thus improving the complexity of my site.</p>
